## Introduction

This project utilizes the Ollama framework to simulate a teaching scenario where agents play roles such as Teacher, Learner, and Evaluator. The primary goal is to develop ideas, explain topics, and create questions for evaluation in an interactive learning environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IrijahBen/teaching-ideas.git
   cd teaching-ideas
Usage
Agents
Teacher: Develops ideas, explains topics, and creates questions for evaluation.
Learner: Asks questions, seeks clarification, and engages in discussions to understand the topics presented by the teacher.
Evaluator: Evaluates learning materials provided by the teacher, asks questions to assess comprehension, and provides feedback.
Teaching Scenario
The Teacher initiates the chat with an introduction and tasks related to teaching ideas. Learners and Evaluators actively participate in the learning process.

bash
Copy code
python teaching_code.py
Evaluation Questions
The Teacher creates two or three questions for evaluation. Example questions:

"What is the main concept discussed in [Topic]?"
"How does [Topic] relate to real-world applications?"
"Can you provide an example illustrating [specific aspect of Topic]?"
Feel free to customize and expand these questions based on the learning objectives.
